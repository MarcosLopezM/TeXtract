34.1 W[J] as the generating functional of connected diagrams.
(a) Take the third variational derivative of W[J] to show that it gives only the
connected contributions to the 3-point function.
(b) Show that W[J] does generate all the connected diagrams for any n-point
function.

34.2 General scalar effective potential.
(a) Calculate the contribution of a fermion to the scalar potential starting with the
Lagrangian L = −1
2φ□φ −V (φ) + i ¯ψ/∂ψ −Y φ ¯ψψ.

as in Eq. (34.66), where si is the spin and ni
d is the real number of degrees of
freedom on-shell for a given particle.

34.3 Calculate the Coleman–Weinberg potential in scalar QED and verify Eq. (34.71).

34.4 Calculate the W- and Z-boson contributions to the Higgs effective potential.

34.5 Improve the Higgs stability bound in the Standard Model.
(a) Show that including the SU(2) × U(1) gauge ﬁelds, you get

(b) Plug in the Standard Model values for g and g′ and see how the lower bound on
the Higgs mass changes.
(c) Calculate βλ = μ d
dμλ and γ2 = μ d
dμh including top and Higgs correction in the
Standard Model.
(d) Solve the RGEs from the previous part to get an RG-improved effective
potential.
(e) What is the lower bound on the Higgs mass for absolute stability using this
RG-improved potential?

34.6 Calculate the coefﬁcient of the A4 vertex in the 1PI effective action using the
background-ﬁeld method.

34.7 Calculate the fermion contributions to the QCD β-function using the background-
ﬁeld method.

34.8 Background-ﬁeld effective action.
(a) Calculate the ﬁnite parts of the vacuum polarization loops from Section 34.3.2
in background-ﬁeld gauge. You should ﬁnd that the ﬁnite parts are in fact ξ$
dependent. For example, the contribution at order ξ$2 comes only from the graph
in Eq. (34.97)
(b) Why is it OK for the ﬁnite parts to have ξ$ dependence, but not the divergent
parts?
