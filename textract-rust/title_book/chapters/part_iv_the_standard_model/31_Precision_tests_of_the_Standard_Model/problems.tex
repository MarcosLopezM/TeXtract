31.1 Calculate the rate for μ−→e−¯νeνμ at tree-level in the 4-Fermi theory and verify
Eq. (31.3).

31.2 Another well-measured quantity is the decay rate of the Z boson into leptons,
Γe+e−≡Γ (Z →e+e−). At tree-level,
Γ(Z →e+e−) =

The current experimental value is Γe+e−≡Γ(Z →e+e−) = 83.99 ± 0.18 MeV.
(a) Evaluate the tree-level prediction for Γe+e−. How many standard deviations is
the result off from the experimental value?
(b) Derive an expression for Γe+e−at 1-loop in terms of MS Lagrangian parameters.
(c) Derive an expression for Γe+e−in terms of vacuum polarization graphs.
(d) Evaluate Γe+e−numerically at 1-loop. How does your answer compare to the
experimental value?

31.3 Calculate the Higgs boson contributions to the various vacuum polarization graphs
exactly. Verify the leading behavior in Eqs. (31.68) and (31.69).

31.4 Flavor-changing b decays:
(a) Calculate the rate for b →sγ in the Standard Model. The relevant graphs have
the photon coming off a W-boson loop.
(b) Match to an effective theory at tree-level so that the b →sγ rate is reproduced.
(c) Evaluate the order αs corrections to the effective theory.
(d) Evolve the operator from mW to mb. How big are the radiative corrections to
this decay rate from QCD?
