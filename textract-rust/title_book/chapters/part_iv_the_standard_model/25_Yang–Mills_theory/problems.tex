25.1 Check that the Yang–Mills Lagrangian in Eq. (25.6) is gauge invariant by explicitly
inserting the transformation in Eq. (25.67).

25.2 Derive Eqs. (25.20) to (25.22).

25.3 Semisimplicity.
(a) The key reason that semisimple Lie algebras are of interest in physics is that all
ﬁnite-dimension representations of semisimple algebras are Hermitian. Prove
this fact.
(b) Prove that the Lorentz algebra so(1, 3) is not semisimple, but its complexiﬁca-
tion su(2) ⊕su(2) is.
(c) An important algebra that is not semisimple is the Heisenberg algebra. It has
three generators p, x and ℏsatisfying [x, p] = iℏand [x, ℏ] = [p, ℏ] = 0. Find a
three-dimensional matrix representation of this algebra. Show that this algebra
is neither simple nor semisimple.

25.4 Anomaly coefﬁcients.
(a) Show that anomaly coefﬁcients for complex conjugate representations are equal
with opposite sign: A(R) = −A
 ¯R

. Conclude that the anomaly coefﬁcient for
a real representation is zero.
(b) Show that for reducible representations A(R1 ⊕R2) = A(R1) + A(R2).
(c) Show that for tensor product representations A(R1 ⊗R2) = A(R1)d(R2) +
d(R1)A(R2).

(d) What is A(10) for SU(4)? You can use that 4⊗4 = 6+10, with 6 being a real
representation.

25.5 Check that the Noether current, Ja
μ = g ¯ψiγμT a
ijψj + gf abcAb
μF c
μν, is conserved on
the equations of motion.

25.6 Show that the path ordering is necessary in the deﬁnition of the non-Abelian Wilson
line, Eq. (25.57), for the transformation property in Eq. (25.63) to be satisﬁed.
(a) First show gauge invariance to leading non-trivial order in perturbation theory.
That is, show that the θ-functions are necessary in Eq. (25.58).
(b) Show that the Wilson line with path ordering satisﬁes Eq. (25.63) exactly.

25.7 Check that the Slavnov operator Δ, deﬁned so that φ →φ + θΔφ for the various
ﬁelds under BRST transformations, is nilpotent Δ2 = 0.
